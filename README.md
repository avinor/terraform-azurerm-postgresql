# PostgresSQL server

Terraform module to create a PostgreSQL server in Azure with set of databases and users. Database allows for custom configuration and enforces SSL for security reasons.

## Limitations

Password is mandatory for database users. Set to null for auto generated password.

## Usage

Examples of usage for this terraform module can be found under the example directory.

Example showing deployment of a server with single database using [tau](https://github.com/avinor/tau)

```terraform
module {
  source  = "avinor/postgresql/azurerm"
  version = "2.0.4"
}

inputs {
  name                = "simple"
  resource_group_name = "simple-postgresql-rg"
  location            = "westeurope"

  sku = {
    capacity = 1
    tier     = "Basic"
    family   = "Gen5"
  }

  databases = [
    {
      name      = "my_database"
      charset   = "UTF8"
      collation = "English_United States.1252"
      users = [
        {
          name     = "a_user"
          password = null
          grants = [
            {
              object_type : "database"
              privileges : ["CREATE"]
            },
            {
              object_type : "table"
              privileges : ["SELECT", "INSERT", "UPDATE"]
            }
          ]
        },
      ]
    },
  ]
}
```

## Diagnostics

Diagnostics settings can be sent to either storage account, event hub or Log Analytics workspace. The variable `diagnostics.destination` is the id of receiver, ie. storage account id, event namespace authorization rule id or log analytics resource id. Depending on what id is it will detect where to send. Unless using event namespace the `eventhub_name` is not required, just set to `null` for storage account and log analytics workspace.

Setting `all` in logs and metrics will send all possible diagnostics to destination. If not using `all` type name of categories to send.

## Grant access

Each user can be given a set of user grants. Each grant consists of an `object_type` and a list of `privileges`.
`object_type` can be one of: `database`, `table`, `sequence` and `function`.
`privileges` can be one or more of: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, `REFERENCES`, `TRIGGER`, `CREATE`, `CONNECT`, `TEMPORARY`, `EXECUTE`, and `USAGE`

Example:

Create a user that can create a table, select from and update it.
To be able to create a table it needs the `CREATE` privilege on the `database` object:
```
{
  object_type : "database"
  privileges : ["CREATE"]
}
```
Note: This does not mean the user is allowed to create a new database.

To be able to select from and update the table, we can give it `SELECT`, `UPDATE` and `INSERT` privileges on the `table` object:
```
{
  object_type : "table"
  privileges : ["SELECT", "INSERT", "UPDATE"]
}
```

For more details on privileges in PostgreSQL see the official documentation: <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/ddl-priv.html>
